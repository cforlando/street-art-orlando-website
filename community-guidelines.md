# STREET ART ORLANDO COMMUNITY GUIDELINES

STREET ART ORLANDO is dedicated to providing a fun and safe way to search, create, and share the best GIFs on the internet. GIPHY GIFs, once indexed, can be seen by anybody using GIPHY; therefore, it’s important to be mindful of the type of GIFs that are appropriate for the site. To do that, we’ve set up a few guidelines that we ask you follow. Thanks for helping us make GIPHY a positive experience for everyone!

# STREET ART ORLANDO Golden Rules:

## Respect Privacy:

It’s important to respect and honor the privacy and consent of the individuals depicted in your GIFS. Make sure you’re authorized to use any images from the appropriate people before you use them to submit a photo.

## Photos that are not allowed on STREET ART ORLANDO:

### Pornography & Explicit Nudity:

You can’t upload anything that depicts any form of sex act or other sexually explicit material. Straight up: Your photos can’t show any explicit nudity at all. Sorry! In general, if it’s not something that you’d show your mom, don’t upload it to STREET ART ORLANDO.

### Violence:

We don’t mind photos that show fictional violence (in other words, pretend play where no one actually gets hurt), but if it’s real, then it’s not allowed. Any photos that portray real death, mutilation, gore, or assault are not permitted.

### Self-Harm:

You can’t upload, or share anything that encourages or promotes self-harm. This includes activities or behavior related to suicide, self-mutilation, or eating disorders.

### Animal Cruelty:

Absolutely no photos of animals being harmed or abused are permitted. Period.

### Bullying, Stalking, Harassment, or Threats:

You can’t, upload, or share photos to bully, harass, or threaten another individual.

### Hate Speech:

Our photos are meant for everyone, so we don’t allow any that slander, demean, or belittle another group or person based upon their race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. Those are a definite no.

Don’t upload, or share photos of illegal activity on STREET ART ORLANDO. You also can’t use STREET ART ORLANDO to engage in or promote illegal activity.

### Private Information:

You can’t upload, or share photos that reveal any private or sensitive information about another person. This includes things such as addresses, phone numbers, passwords, and anything else that could be considered personal.
